This repository is a full-stack **Event Management System** designed to enable users to create, manage, and join events. The system is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **React**, and **Socket.IO** for real-time updates. It also integrates with **Cloudinary** for image uploads and **JWT** for secure authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, login, logout, and check authentication status.
- **Event Management:** Create, edit, delete, and view events with image support.
- **Real-time Updates:** Dynamic updates when users join or leave events using Socket.IO.
